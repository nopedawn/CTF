Elliot felt a strange sense of unease and began to suspect that there might be a hidden message in the sound.

Given a WAV audio [file](https://github.com/nopedawn/CTF/blob/main/CyberHavoc23/The_Cryptic_Sound/Right%20or%20Wrong.wav) that plays strange audio when played, we assume it contains Morse code. 

We can decode it using Morse Audio Decoder website
