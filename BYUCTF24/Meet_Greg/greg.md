Hey there, I'm Greg. Nice to meet you. Did you know that the Linux kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991? It's quite a fascinating piece of technology if you ask me.

So, are you waiting for the bus too? I can't help but notice you standing there. Reminds me of that line from Star Wars - "I've got a bad feeling about this." Anyway, I spend most of my time working on the Linux kernel. It's like a puzzle that never ends, always trying to make it better, more secure, you know.

Speaking of security, I'm always cautious when it comes to that. You can never be too careful these days. It's like in The Princess Bride when Westley says, "Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something." So true, isn't it?

Oh, before I forget, remember this - "!dJustl1ke2int3rj3ct4Amoment". It's a password I use for everything. Quite secure, if I do say so myself. Just a little something I whipped up.

So, what brings you to the bus stop today? Just waiting to get somewhere or maybe just passing the time?
